===========================

**Maintenance Manager is the ultimate maintenance plugin which makes maintenances times on your server way easier!**

I want to make it the best maintenance plugin for Bukkit so I'll do the maximum of myself to make frequent updates and add a maximum of stable features.


##Features:

- /maintenance command manages the maintenance time: /maintenance on|off
- Maintenance schedule. Schedule your maintenance time and advert players with /maintenance on [time before maintenance time] (Optionnal, in minutes)
- Schedule interruption with /maintenance cancel.
- Define the duration of your maintenance with /maintenance on [time before maintenance time] <duration> (Optionnal, in minutes)
- Kicks non-op players and players who don't have the permission to log-in during the maintenance.
- Prevents non authorized players to log-in during maintenance.
- Changes the motd on the multi-player screen when the server is in maintenance.
- Commands can be casted from console or in-game.
- Custom server icon for maintenance.
- Server reload support.
- You can reload the config without restarting the server or reloading it entirely with /maintenance reload.
- Full permissions supported.
- Full texts customization.
- You can choose the number of slots available during a maintenance.
- Manage your plugins in real-time without having to reload or restart the server with /maintenance [enable|disable] (plugin name). Disabled plugins stay disabled after restart or reload until you re-enable it. 
- Countdown in motd when a maintenance has a duration planned. 
- Check the server hardware at any time with /cpu and /ram! 

##Commands:

**/maintenance** is the main command. You'll have to add the following arguments:
* on: turn on the maintenance mode
    - {schedule in minutes} (optionnal)
    - {duration of the maintenance in minutes} (optionnal)
* cancel: cancels a scheduled maintenance. 
* off: turn off the maintenance mode
* reload: reload the plugin's config file
* enable {plugin name}: enable the selected plugin.
* disable {plugin name}: disable the selected plugin.
**Note: If you are not sure about the plugin name, type /plugins.**

**/cpu**: Returns the current use of the server's CPU in percent.

**/ram**: Returns the current use of the server's RAM in percent and the current amount of MB used. Note: These two commands take a little time to perform because it requires to run external native code. Works only with Windows, Linux and MacOS.

##Permissions:

maintenance.maintenance: Allows to start or stop a maintenance.

maintenance.maintenance.cancel: Allows to cancel a scheduled maintenance.

maintenance.access: Allows to enter the server during maintenance mode (and don't be kicked when the maintenance begin)

maintenance.reload: Allows to reload the config file.

maintenance.manage.plugins: Allows to disable or enable plugins.

maintenance.cpu: Allows to perform /cpu command.

maintenance.ram: Allows to perform /ram command.

Of course, OP players have these permissions.

```

*Note: Your icon must be a 64X64 png image! Protected adresses (https://) may not work!*

Advice: If you don't want to change the icon, upload your original one and put the adress in the config file.

**Important: If your server is running without icon, the one which is in the config file will be displayed even out of a maintenance!**

To add colors to your texts, just put 'ยง' and a character from 0-9 and a-f before the words you want to color. Please refer you to this page to know formatting codes: http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes
