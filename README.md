===========================

**Maintenance Manager is the ultimate maintenance plugin which makes maintenances times on your server way easier!**
For the moment, it provides several exclusivities I havn't found anywhere else. It is very simple to use and to configure (even if the configuration is optionnal). I want to make it the best maintenance plugin for Bukkit so I'll do the maximum of myself to make frequent updates and add a maximum of features.

*Current version: 1.01*


##**Check out [this] (https://github.com/JeremGamer/Maintenance-Manager--CB-Plugin/wiki/Download) page for downloads!**##


##Features:

- /maintenance command manages the maintenance time: /maintenance on|off
- Maintenance schedule. Schedule your maintenance time and advert players with /maintenance on [time before maintenance time] (Optionnal, in minutes)
- Schedule interruption with /maintenance cancel.
- Define the duration of your maintenance with /maintenance on [time before maintenance time] <duration> (Optionnal, in minutes)
- Kicks non-op players and players who don't have the permission to log-in during the maintenance.
- Prevents non authorized players to log-in during maintenance.
- Changes the motd on the multi-player screen when the server is in maintenance.
- Commands can be casted from console or in-game.
- Custom server icon for maintenance.
- Server reload support.
- You can reload the config without restarting the server or reloading it entirely with /maintenance reload.
- Full permissions supported.
- Full texts customization.
- You can choose the number of slots available during a maintenance.
- Manage your plugins in real-time without having to reload or restart the server with /maintenance [enable|disable] (plugin name). Disabled plugins stay disabled after restart or reload until you re-enable it. 
- Countdown in motd when a maintenance has a duration planned. 
- Check the server hardware at any time with /cpu and /ram!
- Aliases on /maintenance command. See the Commands section for further informations. 
- Backups on command.

##Commands:

**/maintenance** is the main command. You'll have to add the following arguments:

*Aliases:* **/mmode , /maint**
* on: turn on the maintenance mode
    - {schedule in minutes} (optionnal)
    - {duration of the maintenance in minutes} (optionnal)
* cancel: cancels a scheduled maintenance. 
* off: turn off the maintenance mode
* reload: reload the plugin's config file
* enable {plugin name}: enable the selected plugin.
* disable {plugin name}: disable the selected plugin.
**Note: If you are not sure about the plugin name, type /plugins.**
* backup: Saves the server folder into a zip file located in the "backups" folder.

**/cpu**: Returns the current use of the server's CPU in percent.

**/ram**: Returns the current use of the server's RAM in percent and the current amount of MB used. Note: Works only with Windows, Linux and MacOS.

##Permissions:

maintenance.maintenance: Allows to start or stop a maintenance.

maintenance.maintenance.cancel: Allows to cancel a scheduled maintenance.

maintenance.maintenance.backup: Allows to use the /maintenance backup command.

maintenance.access: Allows to enter the server during maintenance mode (and don't be kicked when the maintenance begin)

maintenance.reload: Allows to reload the config file.

maintenance.manage.plugins: Allows to disable or enable plugins.

maintenance.cpu: Allows to perform /cpu command.

maintenance.ram: Allows to perform /ram command.

Of course, OP players have these permissions. Caution: *maintenance.** doesn't work!


##Configuration:

By default, the config file looks like this:

```
maintenanceModeOnStart: false //Don't touch this line!

```

*Note: Your icon must be a 64X64 png image! Protected adresses (https://) may not work!*

Advice: If you don't want to change the icon, upload your original one and put the adress in the config file.  You can also use a maintenance icon located on your local drive using a file:// URI, e.g. file:///C:/craftbukkit/server-icon-maintenance.png

**Important: If your server is running without icon, the one which is in the config file will be displayed even out of a maintenance!**
